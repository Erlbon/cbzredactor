core/zip_names.py

Entry names in ZIP files written by older tools. Python's zipfile decodes a
name as UTF-8 only when the entry's general-purpose flag 0x800 is set, and
as cp437 otherwise; many tools (and every non-Latin one before ~2010) write
UTF-8 or a local code page WITHOUT the flag, so a page called "Märchen 01.jpg"
showed up as "MÃ¤rchen 01.jpg" -- and rewriting the archive with a fresh
ZipInfo(name) then stored that mojibake for good.

What this module does about it. The raw bytes are always recoverable
exactly (`orig_filename.encode("cp437")`, since cp437 maps every byte), so
for an entry WITHOUT the flag and with a non-ASCII name:

- bytes that are valid UTF-8 are taken to be a UTF-8 name that merely lacks
  the flag: the entry is known by that proper Unicode name (page list,
  sorting, ComicInfo lookup) and written back flagged as UTF-8, which
  repairs the archive for every reader;
- any other bytes (a Shift-JIS, GBK or cp1252 name, say) can't be decoded
  without guessing, so they are kept EXACTLY: the entry is written with
  its original filename bytes and flag bits (RawNameInfo). Its name in the
  app is zipfile's cp437 reading of those bytes -- odd to look at, but
  stable, and never turned into something else on save. No guessed legacy
  decoding is attempted.

decode_zip_name() is the one place that decides a name; open_zip() applies
it to every entry of an opened archive, so all readers (`zf.read(name)` with a
name from the page list included) agree.
